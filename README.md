# MiniGPT: A PyTorch Implementation of GPT from Scratch

A lightweight, educational implementation of the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) architecture built from scratch using PyTorch. This project demonstrates the core concepts of transformer-based language models through a simple, pattern-learning task.

## 📋 Overview

MiniGPT is a minimal implementation of the GPT architecture that learns to predict numerical sequences. The project includes:

- Complete transformer architecture implementation
- Multi-head self-attention mechanism
- Position embeddings
- Training and generation utilities
- Synthetic dataset generation for testing

The model successfully learns to predict sequential patterns, demonstrating the fundamental capabilities of transformer-based architectures.

## 🔧 Model Architecture

### Key Components

1. **Multi-Head Attention (`models/attention.py`)**
   - Implements scaled dot-product attention
   - Supports multiple attention heads
   - Includes linear projections for queries, keys, and values

2. **Transformer Block (`models/transformer.py`)**
   - Multi-head self-attention layer
   - Feed-forward neural network
   - Layer normalization and residual connections

3. **GPT Model (`models/gpt.py`)**
   - Token embeddings
   - Positional embeddings
   - Stack of transformer blocks
   - Output layer for predictions

### Hyperparameters

The model uses the following default hyperparameters (configurable in `config/hyperparameters.py`):

```python
vocab_size = 100
embed_size = 256
num_layers = 3
heads = 4
forward_expansion = 4
dropout = 0.1
max_length = 20
batch_size = 32
epochs = 10
learning_rate = 3e-4
```

## 📝 Implementation Details

### Synthetic Dataset
- Generates sequences following simple patterns
- Each sequence follows the pattern: [x, x+1, x+2, ...]
- Customizable sequence length and vocabulary size

### Training
- Uses AdamW optimizer
- CrossEntropyLoss for sequence prediction
- Implements teacher forcing during training
- Progress tracking with tqdm

### Generation
- Autoregressive generation
- Supports variable-length input sequences
- Maximum sequence length control
- Pattern accuracy evaluation

## 🛠️ Customization

You can customize the model by modifying the hyperparameters in `config/hyperparameters.py`:

```python
# Example: Increase model capacity
hp = Hyperparameters()
hp.embed_size = 512
hp.num_layers = 6
hp.heads = 8
```
